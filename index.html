        <div class="contacts">
            <p>Since the 10th grade, I began to be interested in programming. I really liked it and decided to link my future life with programming. Unfortunately, I have no work experience so I entered the BSUIR. I began to devote more time to programming, but not to the detriment of my studies. In the future, I want to become a web developer, and for this I study HTML, CSS, and JS. I also have a lot of experience in learning English. I studied it in depth for 5 years starting from the 6th grade.
